With the huge amount of time, money, and other resources being utilized in such an implementation, any organization would like to ensure that the returns they get from their ERP are impressive. However, any ERP system runs on data that goes into it, and the data migration project is how your new ERP will get its fill of the fuel it needs.<\/p>\n<p>The discussions around any ERP implementation is, at its core, a discussion of the data contained in it. How that data relates to the business, its environment, and the users who make the business work. This means that data migration is not just an important part of an ERP implementation, but a critical one.<\/p>\n<p>With the 2027 end-of-support deadline for SAP ECC looming, organizations are actively migrating to the next-generation platform \u2013 SAP S\/4HANA.<\/p>\n<p>Migrating to a new system can be daunting, especially for organizations with complex MRO processes in SAP. However, with a well-defined SAP migration strategy that addresses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verdantis.com\/erp-implementation\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;\">MRO data migration<\/span><\/span><\/a> challenges, you can ensure a smooth transition and unlock the full potential of your new system.<\/p>\n<h2>Here are some things that need to be considered during the ERP data migration<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Identifying the data &#8211; The data that needs to be migrated should be clearly identified before the project gets underway, ensuring that efforts are focused on data that matters to the business and redundant\/outdated data pointers are identified and eliminated. This ensures that delays do not creep in the timeline in the later stages.<\/li>\n<li>Timing the migration \u2013 Talking of delays, it is also essential to know beforehand when the migration would be carried out. As real time data might be involved, the timing of the move becomes critical so as not to disrupt the business.<\/li>\n<li>Improving data quality \u2013 This is the part where master data management enters the picture. When you are spending time and money on a new system, it is essential that the data loaded into it is of an acceptable enough quality. To ensure this a data quality initiative should be a part of the data migration.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>An organization has many different types of data and all of it cannot (and should not) be migrated at one go. The most common accepted upon order followed by companies is \u2013<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Configuration Data \u2013 Initial data that needs to be entered once to setup the system.<\/li>\n<li>Master Data \u2013 The data that forms the backbone of most organizations. Should be treated very carefully.<\/li>\n<li>Transaction Data \u2013 This set of data contains most of the real time data and thus should be loaded as the last step.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>ERP, just like all other systems in this world, works on the GIGO principle \u2013 Garbage In, Garbage Out. Corrupt data going in means that the results you get, the analytics you perform on them, and the decisions you take on their basis, would always be suspect.<\/p>\n<p>Data quality improvement is a non-recurring process (in most cases). This means that performing it after data has been migrated to the new ERP will be time taking, cumbersome, expensive, and very challenging. Tackling it during migration makes much more sense.<\/p>\n<p>It might not be obvious, but data quality issues can magnify when data migrates from a legacy system to a new, more advanced ERP system. This is because the new system is bound to have newer applications with a far richer feature set and a stricter data model. A clean data set going in will ensure that you are able to utilize your new ERP system in the best possible way.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Key Data Attributes to be defined<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>One of the most important steps to take while preparing for a ERP data migration project is to define the key attributes of data that need to be validated. This helps everyone involved in the project to understand exactly how the data is to be handled and what is expected of it. Also, it helps in maintaining and even improving the ultimate quality of the data.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of structure, type, or format, source data intended for migration should be validated in terms of the following key attributes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relevance \u2013 Is it relevant to its intended purpose?<\/li>\n<li>Accuracy &#8211; Is it correct and objective, and can it be validated?<\/li>\n<li>Integrity \u2013 Does it have a coherent, logical structure?<\/li>\n<li>Consistency \u2013 Is it consistent and easily to understand?<\/li>\n<li>Completeness \u2013 Does it provide all the information required?<\/li>\n<li>Validity \u2013 Is it within acceptable parameters for the business?<\/li>\n<li>Timeliness \u2013 Is it up to date and available whenever required?<\/li>\n<li>Accessibility \u2013 Can it be easily accessed and exported to the target application?<\/li>\n<li>Compliance \u2013 Does it comply with regulatory standards?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most companies these days are swimming in data of all sorts, and even though they realize it is important, they are not always sure how to utilize it efficiently. On the other hand, the use of ERP, which itself thrives on data, is increasing across the business world, and companies are looking to derive greater returns from the solution. Proper data migration, with the help of an efficient data quality initiative, can ensure that the return on investment in your ERP is boosted. This also ensures higher operational efficiency during the data migration phase, as well as after it.<\/p>\n<p>By taking a proactive approach to MRO data migration and incorporating it into your overall <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.verdantis.com\/erp-implementation\/\">SAP migration strategy<\/a>,<\/span> you can pave the way for a successful transition.
